I am a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan, where I work at the intersection of scientific machine learning, numerical analysis, and high-performance computing.

My research focuses on developing generative models for physics-based systems — particularly flow-based and diffusion-inspired methods for probabilistic surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs). I am especially interested in building *trustworthy* scientific AI systems by combining modern generative modeling with rigorous numerical analysis, including probabilistic rounding-error bounds and mixed-precision computation on GPU hardware.

Broadly, I aim to bridge machine learning and computational science to enable faster, more reliable simulation and uncertainty quantification for complex engineering systems.
