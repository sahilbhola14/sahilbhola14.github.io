I am a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, working with Prof. Karthik Duraisamy in the Computational Aerosciences Lab. My research lies at the intersection of scientific machine learning, numerical analysis, and high-performance computing.

My work focuses on developing generative models for physics-based systems — particularly flow-based and diffusion-inspired methods for probabilistic surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs). I am interested in learning structured representations of complex physical fields to enable fast, uncertainty-aware simulation and decision-making in computational science and engineering.

A central theme of my research is building *trustworthy scientific AI*. I combine modern generative modeling with rigorous floating-point rounding-error analysis to understand reliability under low-precision arithmetic on modern GPU hardware. This includes developing probabilistic error bounds and studying mixed-precision computation for large-scale numerical linear algebra and PDE solvers.

## Research Vision

Modern scientific computing is undergoing a shift: machine learning models are increasingly embedded within traditional numerical simulation pipelines. My goal is to bridge machine learning and computational science in a principled way — designing models that are not only accurate and fast, but also numerically stable, uncertainty-aware, and compatible with high-performance hardware.

I am broadly interested in AI for science and engineering, especially problems that require combining:

- Machine learning
- Numerical methods
- Uncertainty quantification
- High-performance computing
